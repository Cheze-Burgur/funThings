### As seen in Alan Becker's "Animation vs Coding"!*
This program relies on recursion to create an "explosion" of data strings.
+ It will create a 10-ary tree of depth *n*.
+ The recursion depth (*n*) will equal `power`.
+ If `power = 5`, it will create 100000 "leaf" nodes.
+ Each leaf has ten children (numbers 0 - 9)
+ If `power = 5`, it will create 111111 total nodes.

*Note - I have edited the original code from the video slightly, but it all functions the same.
